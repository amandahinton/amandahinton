### RECENT PROJECTS (see pinned repos for code and wikis)

#### Huetility
Huetility makes it easy for software engineers to make smart, accessible color decisions without having to open multiple tools or do the complex math needed to navigate digital colors. The application includes an sRGB color picker, tints and shades, color contrast, vision deficiency emulations, and harmony palettes.

_Built with JavaScript, TypeScript, CSS, Vite, React, React Testing Library, Vitest, and Git/GitHub_

#### Chromaculture (in development)
Chromaculture is an app for interacting with and learning about color, including a swatchbook, a digital magazine, and other color-based tools. Chromaculture Swatchbook organizes detailed swatches, from watercolor paints to nail polish to fabric samples. Users can upload images and select digital swatches, which can be collected into palettes. Browse shared swatches and palettes for inspiration.

_Built with JavaScript, TypeScript, Next.JS, CSS, React, Prisma ORM, Vercel Postgres, and Git/GitHub_

#### Chromaculture Magazine
Chromaculture is a digital magazine that blends color theory, science, art history, industry information, and pop culture in a way that is modern, informative, provocative, and playful. Users can read article previews, bookmark articles to save to their personal collection, and comment on each article.

_Built with JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, CSS, Flask, WTForms, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Heroku, and Docker_

#### Homeslice 
Homeslice is an app for homeowners to manage maintenance and repair activities for their home/s. Users can subscribe to suggested routine upkeep and improvement events or create their own custom tasks. Now homeowners can stay on top of the recurring needs of the property—from roof inspection to gutter cleaning to appliance upkeep—extending and protecting the value and safety of their home.

_Built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, React, Redux, CSS, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Heroku_

#### Whereabouts 
Whereabouts combines social media functionality with location-based adventuring like geocaching. Users will activate one of three missions, travel there and explore that location, share photos and a description of what they found, and interact with posts by fellow adventurers.

_Built with JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, CSS, Flask, WTForms, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, AWS S3, Google Maps, Heroku, and Docker_

_Other contributors: Frema Awuku and Jacky Hao_
