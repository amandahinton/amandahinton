### CURRENT PROJECT
Chromaculture is an app for interacting with and learning about color, including a swatchbook, a digital magazine, and other color-based tools.

Chromaculture Swatchbook is an app for organizing detailed swatches of your collections, from watercolor paints to nail polish to fabric samples. You can upload images and select digital swatches and add customized details for each swatch. Then arrange your swatches into palettes. Browse shared swatches and palettes for inspiration.

Building with Next.js, TypeScript, JavaScript, React, Radix, CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, NextAuth.js, Jest, React Testing Library, and Vercel
